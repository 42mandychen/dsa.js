# dsa.js
Implementations of common data structures and algorithms in JavaScript with modern ES6 and plus.

## Run Code

This project depends on [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to compile ES6 into more compatible JavaScript.

Clone this repo and run

```bash
$ npm install
```

to install dependencies.

Then run

```bash
$ npm run node ./src/structure-test.js
```

to execute a test file on `structure`. So for example,

```bash
$ npm run node ./src/heap-test.js
```

will execute the test files for heap.

## Project Structure

All files are located in [`./src`](./src). If you run

```bash
npm run build
```

locally, these files will be compiled into `./lib`.
